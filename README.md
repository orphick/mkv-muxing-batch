> Fifty episodes should feel like one job—not fifty opportunities for something to go wrong.

MKV Muxing Batch turns a folder full of videos, subtitles, audio tracks, chapters, and attachments into one controlled workflow. Match the files, decide exactly how every track should behave, add the batch to the queue, and let the application carry it to completion.

This maintained fork is built around three promises: **large queues should stay stable, interrupted work should be recoverable, and repetitive metadata work should happen once—not file by file.**

## Why this fork exists

The original project solved a real problem and grew an unusually capable muxing tool. This fork carries that work forward with an active focus on reliability, recovery, and a calmer modern desktop experience.

Recent work includes:

- safer worker and process cleanup for long muxing sessions;
- persistent queues with crash and restart recovery;
- batch templates for video titles and audio/subtitle track names;
- a redesigned dark interface with clear navigation and a queue-first workspace;
- a tested Windows release pipeline with installer, portable archive, and SHA-256 checksums.

## What it does

### Survives the long jobs

The queue is saved automatically. If the application or machine stops unexpectedly, unfinished work is restored on the next launch. Completed jobs remain completed, while the interrupted job is safely returned to the queue instead of being mistaken for a success.

### Handles tracks as tracks—not just files

- Add multiple subtitle and audio sets to every video.
- Configure language, delay, track name, default/forced state, and output position independently.
- Reorder mismatched filenames manually; subtitle and audio filenames do not need to mirror video filenames.
- Inspect existing tracks, discard unwanted tracks, or keep only selected languages and track IDs.
- Modify existing track names, languages, order, default state, and forced state.

### Renames a whole collection in one pass

The **Metadata Names** dialog applies templates across the batch without touching fields you leave blank.

Available placeholders:

```text
{old}       existing title or track name
{filename}  source filename including its extension
{stem}      source filename without its extension
{index}     one-based position in the batch
{language}  configured track language
```

For example, `{stem}` can make every MKV title follow its source filename, while `{language} - {old}` can normalize track names without erasing their original labels.

### Covers the rest of the container

- Add XML chapters per video.
- Attach fonts, artwork, or other files to every output.
- Use expert attachment mode to assign different files or folders to individual videos.
- Skip attachments already present in a source file.
- Preserve logs, add or remove CRC metadata, and control output destinations.
- Save favorite directories, languages, extensions, and other defaults as presets.

## The workflow

1. **Choose videos** — load the source collection and inspect its media information.
2. **Build the container** — match subtitles, audio, chapters, and attachments; configure each track.
3. **Shape the output** — choose a destination, decide which original tracks survive, and apply metadata templates.
4. **Trust the queue** — review the jobs, start muxing, and let automatic persistence protect unfinished work.

## Download

The packaged release supports **64-bit Windows 10 and Windows 11**.

[**Download the latest release →**](https://github.com/orphick/mkv-muxing-batch/releases/latest)

Choose the installer for a normal Windows installation or the portable ZIP when you want a self-contained copy. Each release includes a `SHA256SUMS.txt` file for integrity verification.

### Reporting a crash or frozen interface

The application writes startup details, Qt messages, mux-job transitions, uncaught exceptions, native crash information, and automatic GUI-hang thread dumps to:

```text
%APPDATA%\MKV Muxing Batch GUI\diagnostics.log
```

If the interface freezes, leave it open for at least 15 seconds so the watchdog can record the blocked threads. After closing the application, attach `diagnostics.log` to the issue report. If the file was rotated, also include `diagnostics.log.1`.

## Supported files

- **Video:** AVI, MKV, MP4, M4V, MOV, MPEG, TS, OGG, OGM, H264, H265, WEBM, WMV
- **Subtitle:** ASS, SRT, SSA, SUP, PGS, MKS, VTT
- **Audio:** AAC, AC3, FLAC, EAC3, MKA, M4A, MP3, DTS, DTSMA, THD, WAV, OGG, OPUS
- **Chapter:** XML

The application uses [MKVToolNix](https://mkvtoolnix.download/) for Matroska processing.

## Before muxing

> [!WARNING]
> Leaving the destination folder empty means the application will replace the source videos after asking for confirmation. Keep a backup when working with irreplaceable files.

A few advanced combinations deserve extra care:

- A requested default language or track that does not exist in the source is ignored.
- A **keep only** rule targeting a missing language or track can produce an output with no tracks of that type.
- **Modify Old Tracks** limits overlapping keep/default/reorder controls so conflicting instructions are not applied together.
- New tracks assigned to the same position are inserted in their configured order.
- `Ctrl + Up Arrow` and `Ctrl + Down Arrow` reorder tracks in supported track dialogs.

## Run from source

### Windows

The maintained configuration uses Python 3.14 and PySide6 6.11.2.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/orphick/mkv-muxing-batch.git
cd mkv-muxing-batch
py -3.14 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py
```

### Linux

Install MKVToolNix and the Qt runtime libraries required by your distribution first. On Ubuntu-based systems, these packages cover the common requirements:

```bash
sudo apt install mkvtoolnix libpugixml-dev libmatroska-dev libxcb-cursor0
```

Then create a virtual environment, install the Python dependencies, and start `main.py`:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Linux source usage is available, but the maintainers currently publish and verify packaged releases only for 64-bit Windows.

## Development

Run the automated tests with the project environment:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q
```

Build the Windows installer and portable archive after installing [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php):

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements-build.txt
.\packaging\windows\build_release.ps1
```

Release artifacts and their checksums are written to the `release` directory.

### Updating MKVToolNix

The Windows package includes `mkvmerge` and `mkvpropedit`. Advanced users can replace them inside the application’s `Resources\Tools\Windows64` directory. Keep both executables from the same MKVToolNix release and reinstall the application if an update causes incompatibilities.

On Linux, clear the bundled tool directory only when you intentionally want the application to use the system MKVToolNix installation.

## Roots and acknowledgements

MKV Muxing Batch began as a fork of [yaser01/mkv-muxing-batch-gui](https://github.com/yaser01/mkv-muxing-batch-gui). The foundation, early interface, and breadth of muxing controls came from that project and its contributors.

The substantial 2026 maintenance effort—including the interface redesign,
queue recovery, metadata templates, subtitle-safety work, diagnostic system,
automated tests, and Windows release pipeline—was developed by
[Mohammadreza Mahdavi (`@orphick`)](https://github.com/orphick). The canonical
repository for that work is
[`orphick/mkv-muxing-batch`](https://github.com/orphick/mkv-muxing-batch).

The application relies on [MKVToolNix](https://gitlab.com/mbunkus/mkvtoolnix), whose work makes dependable Matroska tooling possible.

Thank you to everyone who reports a broken edge case, tests a large queue, or suggests a way to make repetitive media work less repetitive.
